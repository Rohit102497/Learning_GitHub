1.	Go to the folder in the terminal where you want to clone the repo of the git.
2.	Clone the repo – Copy the clone url “link” of the repo (HTTPS or SSH).
        git clone link
3.	Go inside the repository in the terminal.
        cd repo 
4.	We can create files inside this repo. Let’s say we add index.html file.
5.	    git status. 
    This shows all the untracked files (changes) between the local repo and the web repo.
6.	To add the changes in the web repo from local, type:
        git add index.html
7.	    git status. 
    This shows all the changes that will be committed to the web repo.
8.	To commit: 
        git commit -m “Initial Commit” 
    This locks all the changes but still doesn’t pushes it in the web repo. -m means to give a message and     “.” Denotes a message.
9.	To push it in the web repo: 
        git push.
10.	To get all the changes from the web repo type: 
        git pull


Adding new line just to check how to get a previous commit.
